# Flawless Finds - Group Project

This is a school project where we worked together as a development team to build a webshop for cosmetics products. The project was carried out using agile methodologies with sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives.

---

## Project Description

We have developed a complete webshop with features to display products, manage a shopping cart, and simulate purchases. The products are fetched via an external API from [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/products), allowing the site to dynamically show real product data without needing a backend.

The project is built using:

- **Vite** as the build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript** for stricter type checking in JavaScript code.
- **HTML/SCSS** for structure and styling.
- Agile workflows with team members rotating as Scrum Master, performing sprint planning and demos.

## Features

- Landing page (homepage) with product listing.
- Product page showing detailed information for each cosmetics product.
- Shopping cart where users can add products, increase/decrease quantities.
- Checkout page to simulate purchases.
- Calculation and display of total price in the cart and checkout.
